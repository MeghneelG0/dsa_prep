# Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm
The algorithm above is known as Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm.

The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm is an efficient algorithm used to find the majority element (an element that appears more than half of the time) in a given array. This algorithm operates in linear time and requires O(1) additional space.

Here are the basic steps of the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm:

- **Candidate Element Selection**: Choose the first element of the array as the candidate element and initialize a counter.

- **Element Counting**: Traverse through the array. If the current element matches the candidate element, increment the counter. If they don't match, decrement the counter.

- **Check Counter**: If the counter becomes zero, choose the current element as the new candidate element and reset the counter to one.

- **Final Candidate Verification**: After these steps, verify if the selected candidate is indeed the majority element.

By following these steps, the algorithm efficiently identifies the most frequently occurring element, if one exists, in linear time O(n) in the worst case. This efficiency is achieved by carefully selecting candidate elements and comparing them against other elements.
