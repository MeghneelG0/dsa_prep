### The 5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- On-demand self service : Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the serviceprovider
- Broad network access : Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity and scalability
- Measured service : Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used. 

### 6 ADVANTAGES OF CC 

- 1. Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX) : 
Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware, Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
- 2. Benefit from massive economies of scale. 
- 3. Stop guessing capacity: actual measured usage
- 4. Increase speed and agility. 
- 5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- 6. Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure.
