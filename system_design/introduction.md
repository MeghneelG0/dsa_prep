## introduction 

System design creates the blueprint for every successful application. It combines databases, APIs, caching layers, load balancers, and distributed queues into a coherent whole. These components must work together to deliver smooth user experiences.

- At its core, system design solves problems at scale.
- Getting a feature working for one user is straightforward. Making it work for millions efficiently and reliably requires balancing competing priorities: speed versus cost, consistency versus availability, simplicity versus flexibility. 
- The challenge lies in finding the right trade-offs for each specific use case.
